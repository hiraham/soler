    <h2>On Grid Solar System in Pakistan</h2>
    <p>On grid, also known as grid-tied solar systems, are widely used solar system for home in the country. In simple terms, it is a solar system where a home is connected to both the electricity grid and the solar system. With on grid solar solutions, homeowners can harness solar energy during the day when the solar panels generate electricity. When the panels are not producing enough electricity, such as at night, the home can draw power from the grid.

This setup reduces your dependence on the grid and can result in a significant reduction of up to 80% in your electricity bills. Moreover, on grid systems offer the option of net metering. This means you can export any excess electricity generated during the day back to the grid and earn credits. These credits can then be used to offset your electricity consumption at night, further decreasing your electricity bill.</p>
